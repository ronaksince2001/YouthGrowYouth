						<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
						<p>Dear YouthGrowYouth,
						<br>
							<p>Let's rewind to the summer of 2020</p>

							
							<p>Having a dream of wanting to fly abroad and pursue my further education, I was overjoyed at the very thought! I soon began my college research and everything that had to do with application requirements and to my surprise, one of the most important factors was extracurriculars.</p>

							
							 <p>I was baffled, “but why do these even matter, aren't my grades good enough”? I questioned myself. Throughout my school era (especially throughout high school) I was so academically oriented that I failed to recognize how incredibly important getting involved in extracurriculars is to build an appealing college application and that grades arent everything.</p>

							 
							 <p>Fast Foward to September 2021.</p>

							 
							 <p>I saw my own peer group struggling with finding opportunities to get involved in extracurriculars. There was no platform to discover resources, no access to personalized career-oriented opportunities, and most importantly no community.
							No longer was my goal to just help my peer group; I instead sought to step boldly into this domain to help several other high school students. </p>

							
							 <p>And so I began researching and posting global opportunities on an account called “Youth Grow Youth” in the hopes that this might help someone — anyone.</p>

							
							 <p>To my surprise, people began noticing Youth Grow Youth and asked to join the cause. I was ecstatic. We soon blossomed into something greater than I could have ever imagined: we expanded beyond monthly opportunities, creating a global network of chapters, an online community of high school students from across the globe, and three conferences in collaboration with Ivy Leagues, among other impactful initiates.</p>

							
							 <p>Today, we stand as a global organization with over 4 chapters across 5 countries, and several accelerators being part of this venture (Harvard University is the most recent accelerator) but more importantly, a safe space all High-schoolers can call Home.</p>

							
							 <p>This community has changed my life. It has made me feel more confident and empowered than I’ve ever been. I can only hope that Youth Grow Youth can touch you the same way it did me. I’m honored to share this space with you.</p>

							<br>
							 <p>With love,
							 
					          <br>

							Founder
